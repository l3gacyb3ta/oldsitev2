Hello! I'm Raleigh (he/they), (aka l3gacy, or l3gacyb3ta, or l3gacy.b3ta, etc...), and this is my homepage! (Sounds like I'm on MySpace lol)  
My blog is in the nav bar on top, and my contacts can be found under the contacts section in the nav bar.  
  
I'm very intrested in stuff like cybersecurity, cryptocurrencies, and musicals. I plan on going into a cybersecurity career at some point, so that's probably gonna be a lot of that on here. I write code in python mostly, but I can also do c++ and I'm learning rust (It looks really cool!). I am a bit of a linux nerd, my laptop is currently quadruple-booting Gardua Linux, Ubuntu 21.04 beta, Arch Linux, and Windows (for school and games). My main IDE is vscode, and I sometimes do some vfx and 3d motion graphics stuff.
